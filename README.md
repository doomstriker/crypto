"# RSA Crypto" 

The project was created by Bridget Damweber and Wilson Burgos. The project uses the Maven framework to build & manage
dependencies. It also uses JDK 1.8 constructs and uses the JUnit test framework.

In order to manage the project you can do so using the following Maven Lifecycle commands:

    compile: compile the source code of the project
    test: test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
    install: install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
    clean: cleans up artifacts created by prior builds

Once the program is compiled you can access the help to print supported options using the command:
    java cs.fit.edu.RSA -h

    usage: RSA [options] 

Options: 

	create RSA keys 
		-K -p public_key_file -s secret_key_file -b bits [1024 default] -y Miller_Rabin_Certainty [99.9999]
	Encrypt
		-e -m plaintext_file -p public_key_file -c ciphertext_file
	Decrypt
		-d -c ciphertext_file -s secret_key_file -m plaintext_file

Create RSA Keys:
In order to generate a RSA private/public key pair the user issues the following command:
    java cs.fit.edu.RSA -K -p public_key_file -s secret_key_file -b bits -y Miller_Rabin_certainty

The content of the files is printed to the console with one number per line, in hex. Each symbol is labelled appropriately. 

Encryption/Decryption:
In order to encrypt/decrypt a message contained in a file use the following commands:

     java cs.fit.edu.RSA -e -m plaintext_file -p public_key_file -c ciphertext_file,
     java cs.fit.edu.RSA -d -c ciphertext_file -s secret_key_file -m plaintext_file.
 

Design:
The project was based on Object Oriented principles. The Object models RSAKey and RSAPrivateKey simply hold the attributes for the keys such as the modulus, exponent, primes and coefficient. These two classes implemented the Marshalling/Unmarshalling interfaces to serialize the model attributes for later storage. The Marshalling interface requires implementation of the mashall() method, respectively the Unmarshalling interface requires the unmarshall() method to recreate the model from a serialized object.
The RSACryptoSystem class implemented the Miller Rabin algorithm in the MillerRabinPrimalityTest() method using the modular exponentiation as well as the EratosthenesSieve. The RSAPrivateKeyâ€™s generateKey() static methods provides an alternative way utilizing the BigInteger.probablePrime implementation.
The ASN1 encoding uses Dr. Silaghi's Java library and the RsaAsn encodes/decodes date to/from a byte array. The system only encodes the private/public key pair, for a future version the message will be encoded as well. 
The PKCS 1.5 padding implementation is handled by RSAKey preEncryption() method, this option is available by setting the pkcsEnabled flag. The RSAPrivateKey postDecryption() method handles the unpacking of the padded bytes. 
The RSA class that handles input/output from the files uses data blocks of public keys bit length encrypt/decrypt the message. 


Test methodology:
Most of the testing focused on the encrypting/decrypting functions. Some of the unit test verify generating key pairs of different bit lengths, verifying the functions reported errors appropriately. It also included verifying the serializing/un-serializing of the keys correctly.
